1. **Gather Data:**
    - Your analysis requires data from the last 24 hours for recent performance and data from the last 7 days for daily averages.
    - You MUST include a time filter in every call to the `explore_data` tool.

2. **Last 24 Hours Analysis:**
    - Calculate total sales and total number of orders.
    - Identify the top-selling products by revenue.
    - Calculate average order value

3. **Sales by Source Analysis:**
    - Analyze traffic sources, referrers, and UTM parameters to determine total sales and conversion rates per source, medium, and/or campaign.

4. **Comparative Analysis:**
    - Calculate the daily average for key metrics (e.g., Total Sales, Total Orders, Avg Order Value) over the last 7 days.
    - Compare the last 24 hours' performance against the 7-day daily averages.

5. **Synthesize Findings:**
    - At the top of the report, write a concise **Executive Summary** of the key findings.
    - Include actionable **Recommendations** based on your analysis. For example, if a marketing channel has a high conversion rate, recommend increasing budget for it.

6. **Structure the Report:**
    - The report should start with the Executive Summary and Recommendations.
    - Follow with sections for "Key Performance Indicators (Last 24 Hours)", "Traffic Source Performance", and "24-hour vs. 7-day Average Comparison".
